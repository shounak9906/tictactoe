# tictactoe

It is an android Tic-tac-toe game app developed using kotlin. 
Its gameplay features include playing 1v1 against another human or against an unbeatable computer.

It uses the minimax algorithm to generate winning moves for the computer.
This was my first project and was live on the playstore from 7/2020 to 1/2022.

An example of the user interface for the 1v1 against friend feature.
